# Twilio Workshop

## Awesome!!!!
Currently this contains the phoneroulette sample project we went over in the workshop.
I'll get Naeem's PHP examples from him as well, and perhaps a choose your own adventure game I never got to show.

## Setup
If you want to run this example on your machine, you'll want the following:
- Python with the flask and twilio libraries (pip install flask twilio)
- A Twilio account and a phone number
- Localtunnel to let people use your app publicly from your machine (gem install localtunnel) (note: not suitable for production)

After you get those setup, you use a twilio phone number, and point the call action to GET http://xxxx.localtunnel.com/phonecall
